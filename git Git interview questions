Git Interview Questions (Copy-Paste Answers)

1. What is Git and why do we use it?
Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in code. It allows multiple developers to collaborate, maintain code history, manage versions, and revert to previous states when needed.

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is a version control tool installed locally. GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories and enables collaboration, code reviews, and CI/CD integration.

3. Explain the Git workflow from developer to production.
Developer creates a feature branch → makes changes → commits locally → pushes to remote → creates Pull Request → code review → merge into main branch → CI/CD pipeline builds, tests, and deploys to staging → after validation, deploy to production.

4. What is the difference between git pull and git fetch?
git fetch downloads changes from remote but does not merge.
git pull = fetch + merge. It downloads and merges changes automatically.

5. What is the difference between git merge and git rebase? Which one do companies prefer and why?
Merge creates a merge commit and preserves history.
Rebase rewrites history and creates a linear timeline.
Companies prefer rebase for clean history but use merge for shared branches to avoid rewriting history.

6. What is a Git conflict? How do you resolve it?
A conflict occurs when multiple changes are made to the same file.
Steps:
- Identify conflicted files
- Edit and resolve manually
- git add file
- git commit

7. You committed a file by mistake. How do you undo the commit?
If not pushed:
git reset --soft HEAD~1
If pushed:
git revert <commit-id>

8. What is the difference between git reset and git revert?
Reset removes commits from history.
Revert creates a new commit that undoes previous changes. Revert is safer in shared environments.

9. What is Git stash? When do you use it in real time?
Git stash temporarily saves uncommitted changes.
Used when switching branches during urgent fixes.

10. How do you recover a deleted branch?
git reflog
git checkout -b branch-name <commit-id>

11. What is cherry-pick? Give a real-time scenario.
Cherry-pick applies a specific commit to another branch.
Used to move a hotfix from dev to production without merging full code.

12. Production issue happened due to a recent commit. How will you find which commit caused the issue?
Use git log, git diff, and git bisect to identify the faulty commit.

13. Explain Git branching strategy used in companies.
Common strategies:
- Git Flow (feature, dev, release, hotfix)
- Trunk-based development
- Environment-based branches (dev, test, prod)

14. What is GitOps? How Git is used in CI/CD pipelines?
GitOps uses Git as the single source of truth. Infrastructure and deployment configs are stored in Git. CI/CD tools monitor changes and automatically deploy.

--------------------------------------------------

Scenario-Based Git Interview

1. A developer pushed wrong config to production. Immediate action?
Revert the commit immediately:
git revert <commit-id>
Trigger deployment and restore service.

2. 3 AM deployment broke the application. Rollback?
Rollback using previous stable tag or commit:
git checkout previous-version
Redeploy.

3. Merge failing due to same file changes?
Pull latest code, resolve conflicts manually, test, then merge.

4. Hotfix required but release branch frozen?
Create hotfix branch from production, fix, test, deploy, then merge back.

5. Sensitive file pushed?
Immediately remove from history:
git filter-repo or BFG tool.
Rotate credentials.

6. Main branch broken?
Revert last merge or rollback to last stable version.

7. CI/CD pipeline fails after merge?
Check logs, verify build, test locally, validate environment configs.

--------------------------------------------------

Real-Time Production Troubleshooting

1. Verify deployed version?
Check commit ID in deployment logs or container image tag.

2. Check current commit in production?
git rev-parse HEAD or check build metadata.

3. Restore deleted file?
git checkout <commit-id> -- file-name

4. Changes not reflecting?
Check:
- Branch deployed
- Pipeline status
- Cache/CDN
- Environment config

5. Handle conflicts under pressure?
Create backup branch, resolve carefully, test, then deploy.

6. Sync staging and production?
Merge staging into production after validation.

7. Git authentication failure in pipeline?
Check tokens, SSH keys, access permissions, expiry.

--------------------------------------------------

Advanced Git Questions

1. Distributed vs centralized?
Distributed: full repo in every system.
Centralized: single central server.

2. How Git ensures data integrity?
Uses SHA hash for every object.

3. Internal working?
Blob = file
Tree = directory
Commit = snapshot
Hash = unique identifier.

4. Shallow clone?
Clone limited history:
git clone --depth=1
Used in CI/CD to save time.

5. Managing huge repos?
Use monorepo tools, partial clone, caching.

6. Monorepo vs multi-repo?
Monorepo = all services in one.
Multi-repo = separate repos.

7. Binary files?
Use Git LFS.

8. Git submodule?
Embed one repo inside another.

9. Git in microservices?
Each service has repo or monorepo with isolated builds.

10. Securing repos?
Access control, encryption, audit, secrets scanning.

--------------------------------------------------

Hands-On Practice Tasks
